## Pitch Invasion: Cyber League 🏏💻

Welcome to the Cyber Stadium, where cricket collides with code.  

This repository contains the simulation assets for our league:  
- Match schedules  
- Player statistics  
- Commentary scripts  
- Stadium notes  

Every run, every wicket, and every exploit counts.  
Your challenge is simple: **break the field, chase the flags.**


## How to Play

1. Clone this repository and explore the files.  
2. Inspect the code, the commentary, and the stats.  
3. Remember: on match day, what you see on the live scoreboard might not tell the full story.  
   - Sometimes the secrets of a match live in the *scorebook*, long after the game has moved on.  
   - Don’t just watch the highlights—**study the replays**.  
4. When you find the flag, hold it high—it’s the winning wicket!
